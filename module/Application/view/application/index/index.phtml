    <h1>Welcome to <span class="zf-green">South Norfolk Youth Symphonic Band +</span></h1>

    <p>
        Welcome!! South Norfolk Youth Symphonic Band + was formed by Mike Booty - who is still Chairman and Musical Director - in 1974. The Band has raised many thousands of pounds for charities and regularly gives around thirty concerts each year. The Band has twice played and been presented to HRH The Princess Royal, once in the Royal Albert Hall. It has performed ‘Tubby the Tuba’, narrated by the late Roy Castle and performed in Europe on many occasions winning third prize in an International Music Festival in Valkenburg, Holland. The Band was presented with the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service in 2006. It has toured Germany five times, most recently in July 2000, the Far East, Singapore, Borneo and Thailand in August 2008. SNYSB returned to the far east in 2012, and plan to go again in 2016.
The Band is completely independent, the only major source of Band income are the two events held each year solely for this purpose (the ‘Songs from the shows’ concert and a Christmas concert).

                    The community is working on developing a community site to
                    serve as a repository and gallery for ZF modules. The
                    project is available <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/modules.zendframework.com">on GitHub</a>.
                    The site is currently live and currently contains a list of
                    some of the modules already available for ZF.
